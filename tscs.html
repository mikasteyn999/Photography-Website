                        <p>
                            Our rates and packages are valid for a limited time only and are subject to review from 
                            time to time, as we see fit. If you have received a Cost Estimate from us in the past 
                            or viewed our Packages on our website, you are by no means guaranteed of said rate, 
                            unless it is our current rate or has been expressly confirmed by us. Cost estimates 
                            are valid for 30 days only.

                        <h3>Booking Reservation</h3>
                        <p>
                            A 50% non-refundable deposit is required to reserve your wedding date and photography 
                            package with Living Light Photography, as per our Invoice/Cost Estimate. We will not 
                            reserve your wedding date for you, unless we have received proof of payment. Bookings 
                            are on a first-come-first-serve basis. Should you have expressed definite interest in 
                            booking a specific date, we will notify you if there is another inquiry for your 
                            wedding date (we will not notify you if you have not responded to our cost estimate as 
                            a result of your inquiry), but reserve the right to book the other couple for said date, 
                            should we not receive confirmation of booking and proof of payment from you within 48 hours.

                        <p>
                            Your session fee is made up of a deposit and balance, payable before your wedding 
                            date and is not refundable. It covers our time and talent and secures your wedding 
                            date at current prices (subject to change from time to time, which might include any 
                            other or future sessions). 50% non-refundable deposit is due on acceptance of our 
                            services and the remaining balance in the week leading up to your wedding, prior to 
                            your wedding day (we do not want to add unnecessary stress to you on your special day 
                            by having to remember to make payments!). No images or products will be provided until 
                            we have received full payment, within the payment period agreed.
